NEXUS AI: Advanced Service Integration with Vanilla JavaScript
NEXUS AI is a cutting-edge Node.js application developed by Justin Cius. It is built using vanilla JavaScript for a lean, high-performance frontend and incorporates powerful external data processing capabilities via Node.js for the backend.

The project showcases a direct, secure integration approach using key NPM packages:

@mistralai/mistralai (or similar SDK): This core dependency enables direct communication with the Mistral platform. It is used to send user queries, manage conversation context, and process the high-quality, efficient responses from the Mistral models.

prompt: Likely used for structured management of user input and instruction templates, ensuring effective and focused interactions with the external service.
